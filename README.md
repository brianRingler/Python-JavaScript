# Python-JavaScript
***
I started working with Flask and JavaScript a few weeks for a new project. When working with JS, I 
was noticing that Python and JS seemed similar.  I thought it would be interesting to build notebooks 
showing the same tasks completed in both languages. 

For now, I am using Jupyter Notebooks with a Python 3 kernel. Then when running a cell with JS code
simply start the cell with `%%js` or `%%javascript` (magic commands).  However, I can only log/print one line 
at a time and have to use `element.text` instead of `console.log`.   

Additionally, I tried using JupyterLab and was unable to run JavaScript the same way in the classic notebook. However, you can use a JaveScript (Node.js) kernal and simply run JavaScript.

Comparing the JavaScript and Python `class`. We start with exploring the JS `constructor` pre **ES6** and then switch 
to post **ES6** when JS introduces  <span style='color:green'><strong>class</strong></span>.
